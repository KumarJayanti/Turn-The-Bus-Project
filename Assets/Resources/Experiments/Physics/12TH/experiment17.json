  "Procedure": [
    "Note the least count of the given voltmeter and microammeter.",
    "The voltmeter and microammeter should read zero with zero applied voltage. If not, then correct the initial reading of the meter suitably.",
    "Take care that Zener diode is in reverse bias mode and the terminal of the microammeter and voltmeter marked positive are connected to the higher potential side of the power supply.",
    "Switch on the power supply.",
    "Move the contact point of the potential divider to apply some reverse bias voltage (Vr). For low reverse bias, the current is negligibly small i.e., of the order of 10–8 A to 10–10 A and hence with milliammeter or microammeter, you will observe zero reading.",
    "Slowly increase the voltage across the Zener diode in steps and record the value of reverse bias voltage Vr and also record the corresponding reverse current Ir from the reading of the microammeter. Take care that the reverse voltage Vr is increased in steps of 0.1 V."
