    "Connect different electrical components as shown in the circuit (Fig. E 5.1). After checking the circuit connections, close key K1.",
    "With keys K2 and K3 open and a protective high resistance P from the RBOX 2, find the position of the balance point. For final reading, short circuit the resistance P by closing the key K3 and find the balance length l0.",
    "Take R = 10 Ω (from RBOX 1), close the key K2 and quickly measure the new balance length l. Open K2 as soon as this has been done.",
    "Keep the readings in the ammeter constant throughout the above observation.",
    "Reduce the value of R in equal steps of 1 Ω and for each value of R obtain the balance length l.",
    "At the end of the experiment, open key K2 and repeat step 2 to find l0 again."
