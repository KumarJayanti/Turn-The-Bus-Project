        "Connect different electrical components as shown in the circuit (Fig. E 5.1). After checking the circuit connections, close key K1.",
        "With keys K2 and K3 open and a protective high resistance P from the RBOX 2, find the position of the balance point. For final reading, short circuit the resistance P by closing the key K3 and find the balance length l0.",
